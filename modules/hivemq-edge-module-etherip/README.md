# EtherIP Dependency

For interacting with Ethernet IP/CIP devices we rely on an open source library which isn't published on Maven-Central:

[EtherIP](https://github.com/ornl-epics/etherip/)

We build the library internall and provide the binary in **libs/etherip-1.0.0.jar**.

In case you want to build the libary yourself simply check out the original project, build the libary and put it into 
the libs folder.
